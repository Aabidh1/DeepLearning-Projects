# Deep Learning - Projects

**01. Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Neural Network**

- **Data Acquisition**: The project uses Yahoo Finance (yf) to download historical stock prices for Apple (AAPL) from a specified start date to today’s date.

- **Data Visualization**: It includes a Candlestick chart created with Plotly to visualize Apple’s stock price movements, highlighting the highs and lows.

- **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix is computed to understand the relationship between different features and the ‘Close’ price of the stock.

- **LSTM Model**: The project constructs and trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on features like Open, High, Low, and Volume.

**02. Image Classification with Neural Networks**

- **Library Import**: It starts with importing necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

- **Data Acquisition**: The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset for fashion image.
  
- **Model Building**: A neural network model with two hidden layers is constructed for image classification.
  
- **Training**: The model is trained on the dataset, and the training process includes splitting the data into training and validation sets.

- **Prediction**: Finally, the model is used to predict the classes of new images, showcasing the output of the predictions.
