# Deep Learning - Projects

**01. Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Neural Network**

- **Data Acquisition**: The project uses Yahoo Finance (yf) to download historical stock prices for Apple (AAPL) from a specified start date to today’s date.

- **Data Visualization**: It includes a Candlestick chart created with Plotly to visualize Apple’s stock price movements, highlighting the highs and lows.

- **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix is computed to understand the relationship between different features and the ‘Close’ price of the stock.

- **LSTM Model**: The project constructs and trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on features like Open, High, Low, and Volume.
